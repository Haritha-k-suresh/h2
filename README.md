## Challenges Faced
- **Lack of Frontend Development Knowledge**
As a beginner, learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from scratch was challenging. Understanding how to structure, style, and add interactivity to a webpage required significant effort.

- **Limited Experience With GitHub**
Managing a repository, understanding version control, and learning GitHub workflows like commits, branches, and pull requests were completely new concepts.

- **Learning to Work With APIs**
Understanding how to interact with APIs, including handling API keys, asynchronous requests, and parsing JSON responses, was a steep learning curve.

- **Mastering JavaScript Basics**
JavaScript posed challenges in terms of syntax, debugging, and implementing features like asynchronous data fetching and DOM manipulation.

- **Processing Weather Data**
Extracting and utilizing data from the weather API, such as temperature and conditions, required a clear understanding of API responses and their structure.

- **Designing a Responsive User Interface**
Creating a visually appealing and user-friendly interface, while ensuring responsiveness across devices, demanded learning advanced CSS techniques and media queries.

- **Logical Implementation of Recommendations**
Developing meaningful and context-aware outfit recommendations based on weather conditions required thoughtful planning and logical decision-making.

- **Debugging and Error Handling**
Troubleshooting and resolving issues, especially in JavaScript and API integration, required patience and a methodical approach.

- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**
Ensuring the webpage functioned seamlessly across multiple browsers added complexity to testing and debugging processes.

- **Time Management**
Balancing learning new concepts, applying them to the project, and managing development timelines as a beginner was a significant challenge.
